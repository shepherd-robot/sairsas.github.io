description: Intelligent controllers and autonomous navigation systems are promoting the inclusion of robotic systems in agriculture, redefining the way that crop management, yield optimization, and resource utilization are executed. This presentation explores the integration of intelligent controllers and autonomous navigation emphasizing their potential to enhance reliability, efficiency, sustainability, and productivity. Intelligent controllers, often based on Artificial Intelligence and Machine Learning, offer data-driven decision-making capabilities that enable real-time assessment of crop status, pest infestations, and environmental conditions. This presentation also addresses the inclusion of intelligent controllers and autonomous navigation capabilities in the WeLASER mobile platform. The project "Sustainable Weed Management in Agriculture with Laser-based Autonomous Tools (WeLASER)", funded by the European Union's Horizon 2020 research and innovation program under grant agreement No 101000256, aims to merge current technologies to build, assess and push into the market a precision weeding equipment based on high-power laser sources and autonomous mobile systems with the main objective of eliminating the use of herbicides while improving productivity and competitiveness.
